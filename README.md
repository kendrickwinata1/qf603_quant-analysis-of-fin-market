# Bitcoin Trading Strategy Models

## Project Description
This repository contains the development of trading strategy models designed to predict Bitcoin returns using advanced statistical methods. The models include a variety of time series and regression analysis techniques, enhancing the accuracy of Bitcoin return predictions.

### Techniques Used:
- **ARIMA (Autoregressive Integrated Moving Average)**
- **ARIMAX (Autoregressive Integrated Moving Average with Explanatory Variable)**
- **VAR (Vector Autoregression)**
- **VECM (Vector Error Correction Model)**
- **Multiple Linear Regression**

Data preprocessing is a critical component of the modeling process, involving:
- Stationarity checks using ADF (Augmented Dickey-Fuller) and KPSS (Kwiatkowski-Phillips-Schmidt-Shin) tests
- Autocorrelation analysis through ACF (Autocorrelation Function) and PACF (Partial Autocorrelation Function) plotting
- Residual checks including Ljung-Box test, Jarque-Bera test, and Durbin-Watson statistic for analyzing the residuals of the models.
